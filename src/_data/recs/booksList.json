    "title": "Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)",
    "author": "Carol Tavris, Elliot Aronson",
    "review": "Wow do we make a lot of irrational decisions. Try to step back to avoid sliding down the pyramid of self-justification.

Oh and Russia's successfully infected and lured more than a handful of Americans to their side."
