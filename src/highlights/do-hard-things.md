## Exercise one: Go deep to understand nuance

- **Number one: Get specific.**
	- Experience feelings closely related to the situation you're working on.
	- Example: If scared of heights, go stand somewhere tall. If experiencing social anxiety, put yourself in an uncomfortable social situation.
- **Step two: Go into the feelings and sensations.**
	- Direct attention to the experienced feelings and sensations.
	- Sit with the sensation without judging.

## Exercise two: Meme it

- **Number one: Develop a vocabulary.**
	- Expand your vocabulary of emotions you're feeling.
	- Example: Instead of just "angry," use words like "withdrawn."
- **Number two: Describe the feeling.**
	- Get creative and describe the feeling in multiple ways.
	- Example: Describe pain as burning, dull, transient, or constant.
- **Number three: Separate the feeling from physiology.**
	- Differentiate physical sensations (sweaty palms, racing heart) from the associated emotions (anxiety, fear).
- **Number four: Name it.**
	- Identify the nuanced differences between emotions based on context.
	- For example, label pre-talk nerves as "performance adrenaline." Naming something empowers and controls it.
- **Number five: Reappraise it.**
	- Reframe the emotional signals as helpful information.
	- View anxiety, fear, pain, and sadness as messages conveying important information.

## Highlights
- Real toughness is about providing the tool set to handle adversity.
- Real toughness is experiencing discomfort or distress, leaning in, paying attention, and creating space to take thoughtful action. It’s navigating discomfort to make the best decision you can.
- Research consistently shows that tougher individuals are able to perceive stressful situations as challenges instead of threats.
- When self-esteem is contingent, it’s fragile. When it’s based on external rewards or praise, it’s dependent on something over which we have little control.
- We lose the ability to try. Lack of control extinguishes the flame of even the most motivated. When we lack control, when we feel like no matter what we do, it doesn’t make any difference, our brain is getting the message “What’s the point?”
- Our level of control changes how we respond to stress. When we have a sense of control, our alarm is quieter and easier to shut off.
- You don’t need to be “back to normal” the day after a major loss, but you can take small steps toward normalcy to flex your control muscle: going for a walk instead of a full-blown workout, meeting friends for coffee, spending an hour a day diving back into your work project.
- When we put people in a position to choose, we can “switch on” and train their prefrontal cortex, allowing them to understand and regulate the sensations of pain, fatigue, and anxiety that often come with such difficult moments.
- Instead of wrestling the giant monster, start with the smallest item that you can have control over that’s related to the problem. Is it your breath? Can you intentionally slow your breathing down? Or maybe it’s something as simple as showing up on time or getting through the first mile of your marathon. Break it down to something manageable and feasible.
- If we direct our attention toward an emotion or sensation, examining the feedback for long enough, we can start to distinguish shades of gray where there was once a single category. Go toward the discomfort, deliberately focusing your attention, so that you can peel back the layers.
- Another strategy that allows us to understand the nuance of signals and sever the bond they have with actions is to label them. We can interpret very similar sensations (increased heart rate, sweaty palms, a touch of jitters) in drastically different ways—from nervousness to excitement.
- Clinical psychologists employ this same concept by utilizing items such as the emotion wheel, a graphic that lists common feelings, such as angry, and pushes us to consider more granular versions, like resentful, indignant, furious, jealous, or withdrawn.
- When we name something, we take back control—converting the ambiguous to something tangible that we can understand, manipulate, and come to terms with.
- Toughness is about accurately reading these signals—knowing what your body is saying and being able to decide whether or not to respond.
- Faced with fatigue, discomfort, and the pressure of obtaining only one of four spots to qualify for nationals, I didn’t resort to powering through. I processed through. True toughness is about navigating. It’s paying attention to the voices in my head, and making adjustments to address or overcome them.
- Sometimes that meant giving more power to that voice, by talking out loud. Other times, it meant letting that inner thought float on by.
- The more the child was distanced from his inner self, the longer he or she persisted. “It’s easier to give advice to a friend than to yourself” is an adage that most of us have heard, and it largely holds.
- Respond to reality. For most of us, we are not only responding to the actual stress but the reverberations of it. Tough individuals learn to match perception with reality so that they marshal the appropriate response instead of an exaggerated one.
- A calm conversation is about slowing the world down, creating space between fatigue and freak-out. It’s developing the ability to coolly, quietly, and nonjudgmentally work your way through a difficult situation.
- We can develop the same skill when we work out, but also during everyday activities like cooking dinner, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a walk. Notice the sensations and thoughts that arise, trying not to judge or assign meaning to them.
- A narrow focus doesn’t just leave our imagination empty; it plays a large role in rumination and depression.
- If we find ourselves getting narrow, counteract by going broad.
- This theory helps explain the advice that “Mood follows action.” When we’re feeling sad and down, trying to alter our mood seldom works. But if instead of trying to force your mood to change you change your behavior—getting out of bed and going for a walk—you often find yourself in a much better, happier place.
- The first step in utilizing any of the strategies below is to decide whether you need to zoom in or zoom out. Remember, stress causes us to narrow because it’s advantageous for a short period of time.
- When you are going through a difficult time, ask how you might feel about this in six months, a year, or even ten years down the line. Imagining how future you would think about your current situation often reminds us that whatever we are going through is temporary.
- Remember from chapter 7 that when we switch from first person to either second or third person, we are putting distance between what’s occurring and our response to it. This doesn’t just apply to our inner dialogue, but journaling using second or third person can also help us process our emotions.
- You can’t force cohesion or unity. It doesn’t come from trust falls, gimmicky bonding activities, or forced interaction. It comes from being real. From allowing people to lower their defenses and feel comfortable enough to be who they are. You can’t force it. All you can do is create the space for it to happen. The magic wasn’t in Popovich’s team dinners. It was in his creating space for genuine interaction.
- Coyle makes the case that contrary to the way we traditionally think about it, we don’t need trust before we can become vulnerable. The opposite is true. In order to trust, we first must be vulnerable.
- Being open and vulnerable sends an invitation to the person sitting across from you that you trust them. If that signal is reciprocated, that trust between the pair increases. We lower our defenses and guard, feeling open to being who we are. The more this cycle repeats, the stronger trust and cooperation become.
- Instead, if we wanted to be fulfilled, there were three ways to achieve this.
- First, the act of doing. Creating—whether it be in an artistic pursuit or a labor of love—brought meaning to one’s life.
- The second was in experiencing—nature, love, art, or anything that might create the sensation of awe and expand one’s perspective of the world.
- The third key to fulfillment would catch most off guard, but this particular audience was likely expecting it: suffering.
- To him, suffering wasn’t to be sought out. But if we found ourselves there, meaning could be extracted. Suffering strips us of our vanities and allows us an opportunity to respond.
- Purpose is the fuel that allows you to be tough.
- Todd Kashdan found that it was those who navigated their anxiety and trauma not via avoidance but through exploration who experienced the highest levels of growth.
- When we explore instead of avoid, we are able to integrate the experience into our story. We’re able to make meaning out of struggle, out of suffering. Meaning is the glue that holds our mind together, allowing us to both respond and recover.
