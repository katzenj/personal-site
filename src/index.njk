  {# I guess tell the people who I am #}
  <p class="mb-6">
  Howdy. I'm Jordan, an engineer, wannabe writer, opinion provider, and reader. I currently work at Settle building the operating system for inventory-based businesses. 
  This site is meant as a dumping ground for the occasional "essay" (if you can call it that), "note" (whatever that means), or whatever else I feel like putting here ðŸ¤—.
  <p>
  <p class="mb-10">
  If you've found yourself here, I'm going to shamelessly plug my <a class="italic underline" target="_blank" href="https://give.achillesinternational.org/jordan">fundraiser</a> 
  for Achilles International. I'm raising money as part of the 2024 TCS NYC Marathon and get to support athletes with disabilities at the same time.
