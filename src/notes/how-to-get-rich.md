## Highlights
- If it flies, floats or fornicates, always rent it—it’s cheaper in the long run.
  - Note: I agree with the first two (flies and floats). I don't agree with the last.
- fear of failing in the eyes of the world is the single biggest impediment to amassing wealth.
- Inclinations are easy to list. Aptitude is far less so. Trial and error, combined with fierce determination and a willingness to discard cherished perceptions about ourselves, is the best that I can suggest.
- “Luck is preparation multiplied by opportunity.” — SENECA, ROMAN PHILOSOPHER “The harder I practiced, the luckier I got.” — GARY PLAYER, GOLF CHAMPION “Luck is a dividend of sweat.” —RAY KROC, MCDONALD’S FOUNDER
- Whatever your inclinations, your aptitude, your abilities or your preferences, never shrink when opportunities arrive.
- More important, it really does not matter who gives birth to any particular idea.
- Having a great idea is simply not enough. The eventual goal is vastly more important than any idea. It is how ideas are implemented that counts in the long run.
- If you cannot bear the thought of prostrating yourself to obtain the seed corn, then you will almost certainly never own the farm. “To get what you need / You toady to greed.” Or else, you ask; very, very nicely indeed.
- “Assumption is the mother of all f***-ups.”
- It is my hope that this book will cause you to consider very carefully whether you are truly driven by inner demons to be rich. If you are not, then my earnest and heartfelt advice to you is: do not on any account make the attempt.
- Whether the sacrifices involved—not only your own, but those you will ask of your family, present or future—are worth the tyranny that such ambition, by its very nature, exacts.
- And there is worse yet. Such an attempt, without the conviction to sustain it, can bring the worst of all worlds, for if a person does achieve wealth, at great personal sacrifice, they will have at least acquired a vast fortune in assets or in cash. But to make the attempt without sufficient passion and commitment, knowing in your heart of hearts that you lack the conviction to succeed, risks the suffering of a self-inflicted plague without even the consolations the loot may bring.
- Do not mistake desire for compulsion.
- Factoring is a deal with the devil, and just like Faust, you will have the worst of the bargain.
- Ideally, you should never do it at all. And that’s all I have to say about smoking cigarettes or factoring. Both deeply unpleasant, unhealthy and pernicious activities.
- Stubbornness is not persistence. Stubbornness implies you intend to persist despite plentiful evidence that you should not.
- Quitting is not dishonorable. Quitting when you believe you can still succeed is.
- believe in yourself, then why should anyone else? Without self-belief nothing can be accomplished. With it, nothing is impossible.
- As H. L. Mencken put it: “The chief value of money lies in the fact that one lives in a world in which it is overestimated.”
- Prepare yourself for luck, but don’t seek her out. Let her come to you.
- Stay the course. Stop looking for the green grass over the hill.
- Most of us are rather poor negotiators. • Most negotiations are unnecessary. • “The other side” is often just as smart (or stupid) as you are. • In the end, “the balance of weakness” almost always decides the issue. • In Greed vs. Need, the former usually “wins.”
- But if you chase money desperately in the earnest belief that you can never be happy without it and seriously think that the chase is a meaningful occupation, I doubt very much you will succeed.
- “To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.”
- Ownership is not the most important thing. It is the only thing that counts.
- Do not seek a replica of yourself to delegate to, or to promote. Watch out for this, it is a common error with people setting out to build a company. You have strengths and you have weaknesses in your own character. It makes no sense to increase those strengths your organization already possesses and not address the weaknesses.
- More money is usually lost holding on to an asset than is made waiting for the zenith of its value.
- Keep your eye on the ball if you wish to get rich. And do not forget which ball. It’s the one marked “The Money is Here.”
- So focus on your business, whatever it is. It represents what you are. It should be a source of pride as well as a source of money.
- Happiness? Do not make me laugh. The rich are not happy. I have yet to meet a single really rich happy man or woman—and I have met many rich people.
- Now you must cut yourself loose from naysayers and negative influences: the Jeremiahs.
- Cutting loose can be painful. I have heard of very few men or women who made a ton of money who did not leave, or divorce, their wives or husbands or lovers sooner or later. Or who were not estranged from family members, often their children. It comes with the territory.
- Never stop looking for talent and promoting talent. This single suggestion will keep anyone rich. Talent is all most companies consist of.
- No deal is a “must-do” deal.

## TL;DR
1. Analyze your need. Desire is insufficient. Compulsion is mandatory. 
2. Cut loose from negative influences. Never give in. Stay the course.
3. Ignore “great ideas.” Concentrate on great execution. 
4. Focus. Keep your eye on the ball marked “The Money is Here.”. 
5. Hire talent smarter than you. Delegate. Share the annual pie. 
6. Ownership is the real “secret.” Hold on to every percentage point you can.
7. Sell before you need to, or when bored. Empty your mind when negotiating. 
8. Fear nothing and no one. Get rich. Remember to give it all away.
