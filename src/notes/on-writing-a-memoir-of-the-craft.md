# Takeaways

- Good story ideas can come from anywhere. They can also come from two unrelated ideas coming together and making something new
- Recognize good story ideas when they show up, don't try to find them
- If you write, someone will try to make you feel lousy about it — ignore them
- Use the first word that comes to your mind if it is appropriate and colorful
- The adverb is not your friend
- Let go of fear and affectation and making good choices
- [Make good choices when picking tools](/notes/make-good-choices-choosing-tools)
- Stories and novels consist of three parts:
  - narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z;
  - description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and
  - dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech.
- A strong enough situation can render the whole question of plot moot
  - The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question: What if vampires invaded a small New England village? (’Salem’s Lot)
- Description should begin in the writer’s imagination but finish in the reader’s
- Locale and texture are more important than physical descriptions of the players
- Good description consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else
- Don't be self-indulgent or rely on clichéd similes, metaphors, and images
- The best stories are character-driven
- Good fiction always begins with the story and progresses to theme
- Backstory is important, but most of it isn't very interesting.
  - Everyone has a history

# Highlights

Let’s get one thing clear right now, shall we? There is no Idea Dump, no Story Central, no Island of the Buried Bestsellers; good story ideas seem to come quite literally from nowhere, sailing at you right out of the empty sky: two previously unrelated ideas come together and make something new under the sun. Your job isn’t to find these ideas but to recognize them when they show up.


I was ashamed. I have spent a good many years since—too many, I think—being ashamed about what I write. I think I was forty before I realized that almost every writer of fiction and poetry who has ever published a line has been accused by someone of wasting his or her God-given talent.


If you write (or paint or dance or sculpt or sing, I suppose), someone will try to make you feel lousy about it, that’s all. I’m not editorializing, just trying to give you the facts as I see them.


Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful.


The adverb is not your friend.


Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define some sorts of writing as “good” and other sorts as “bad,” is fearful behavior. Good writing is also about making good choices when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with.


In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts: narration, which moves the story from point A to point B and finally to point Z; description, which creates a sensory reality for the reader; and dialogue, which brings characters to life through their speech.


A strong enough situation renders the whole question of plot moot, which is fine with me. The most interesting situations can usually be expressed as a What-if question: What if vampires invaded a small New England village? (’Salem’s Lot)


I can’t remember many cases where I felt I had to describe what the people in a story of mine looked like—I’d rather let the reader supply the faces, the builds, and the clothing as well.


Description begins in the writer’s imagination, but should finish in the reader’s.


I think locale and texture are much more important to the reader’s sense of actually being in the story than any physical description of the players. Nor do I think that physical description should be a shortcut to character. So spare me, if you please, the hero’s sharply intelligent blue eyes and outthrust determined chin; likewise the heroine’s arrogant cheekbones. This sort of thing is bad technique and lazy writing, the equivalent of all those tiresome adverbs.


For me, good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. In most cases, these details will be the first ones that come to mind.


I’ve already spilled enough ink here for me to indicate Palm Too will be a major setting for my story. If it turns out not to be, I’d do well to revise the descriptive stuff down by a few lines in the next draft. Certainly I couldn’t keep it in on the grounds that it’s good; it should be good, if I’m being paid to do it. What I’m not being paid to do is be self-indulgent.


By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects—a restaurant bar and a cave, a mirror and a mirage—we are sometimes able to see an old thing in a new and vivid way.


The most common—and again, landing in this trap can usually be traced back to not enough reading—is the use of clichéd similes, metaphors, and images. He ran like a madman, she was pretty as a summer day, the guy was a hot ticket, Bob fought like a tiger… don’t waste my time (or anyone’s) with such chestnuts.


I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven. Once you get beyond the short story, though (two to four thousand words, let’s say), I’m not much of a believer in the so-called character study; I think that in the end, the story should always be the boss.


I should close this little sermonette with a word of warning—starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a recipe for bad fiction. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story.


The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting.
