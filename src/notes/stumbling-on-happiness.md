## Presentism

- On the other hand, most people would rather receive $19 today than $20 tomorrow because a one-day delay that takes place in the near future looks (from here) to be an unbearable torment.26 Whatever amount of pain a one-day wait entails, that pain is surely the same whenever it is experienced; and yet, people imagine a near-future pain as so severe that they will gladly pay a dollar to avoid it, but a far-future pain as so mild that they will gladly accept a dollar to endure it.
- The problem isn’t that our brains fill in and leave out. God help us if they didn’t. No, the problem is that they do this so well that we aren’t aware it is happening. As such, we tend to accept the brain’s products uncritically and expect the future to unfold with the details—and with only the details—that the brain has imagined.
- “When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.” In other words, when scientists make erroneous predictions, they almost always err by predicting that the future will be too much like the present.
- “People misremember their own pasts by recalling that they once thought, did, and said what they now think, do, and say.“
- When people imagine sounds, they show activation in a sensory area of the brain called the auditory cortex, which is normally activated only when we hear real sounds with our ears.
- Rather, we are saying that when we imagine eating pizza we experience a small, lovely feeling, and that we interpret this feeling as an indicator of the even larger and lovelier feeling we would experience if we could just get the pizza out of our imaginations and into our mouths.
- Just as imagination previews objects, so does it prefeel events.
- Prefeeling allowed nonthinkers to predict their future satisfaction more accurately than thinkers did. Indeed, when people are prevented from feeling emotion in the present, they become temporarily unable to predict how they will feel in the future.
- Future events may request access to the emotional areas of our brains, but current events almost always get the right of way.
- We cannot feel good about an imaginary future when we are busy feeling bad about an actual present
- when episodes are sufficiently separated in time, variety is not only unnecessary—it can actually be costly.
- When your bites are separated by anything greater than ten minutes (in this case, fifteen minutes), then habituation no longer occurs, which means that every bite is as good as the first and a bite of gumbo is never better than a bite of partridge. In other words, if you could eat slowly enough, then variety would not only be unnecessary, it would actually be costly, because a bite of gumbo would always provide less pleasure than yet another bite of partridge.

### Presentism in the Future

- Most of us have a difficult time imagining a tomorrow that’s terribly different from today. We find it difficult to imagine we’ll think, want, or feel differently than we do now.
- “Condemning Thomas Jefferson for keeping slaves or Sigmund Freud for patronizing women is a bit like arresting someone today for having driven without a seatbelt in 1923.”

## Rationalization (Part V)

- Negative events have an impact on us, but the perceived effects are usually not as intense or long lasting as we expect them to be.
- “Able-bodied people are willing to pay far more to avoid becoming disabled than disabled people are willing to pay to become able-bodies again because able-bodied people underestimate how happy disabled people are.”

Chapter 8
- “We derive support for our preferred conclusions by listening to the words that we put in the mouths of people who have already been preselected for their willingness to say what we want.”
- “Am I the best lover you’ve had?” vs. “What do you like best about my lovemaking?”
  - Really only one “correct” answer aka the one we want to hear for Q1 but Q2 only has one answer that could make us feel bad
  - People intuitively lean toward asking the questions that are most likely to elicit the answers they want to hear.
  - When we hear those answers, we tend to believe them (despite the fact that we pushed them)
- When the word hostile is flashed, volunteers judge others negatively.3 When the word elderly is flashed, volunteers walk slowly.4 When the word stupid is flashed, volunteers perform poorly on tests.5 When these volunteers are later asked to explain why they judged, walked, or scored the way they did, two things happen: First, they don’t know, and second, they do not say, “I don’t know.” Instead, their brains quickly consider the facts of which they are aware (“I walked slowly”) and draw the same kinds of plausible but mistaken inferences about themselves that an observer would probably draw about them (“I’m tired”).

Chapter 9
- “We **expect** to feel more regret when we learn about alternatives to our choices than when we don’t, when we accept bad advice than when we reject good advice, when our bad choices are unusual rather than conventional, and when we fail by a narrow mating rather than by a wide margin.“ → but this is **NOT** the case
- In the long run, we seem to regret **_not_** having done something’s much more than we regret **_doing_** things.
  - Why? → psychological immune system has an easier time manufacturing positive and credible views of actions than inactions.
  - E.g. marry someone who was wrong for you (murderer for example) → Easier to think of things you learned
  - But if inaction causes us to reject a marriage proposal from someone who later becomes a movie star, there’s nothing to console ourselves about
- Indeed, in the long run, people of every age and in every walk of life seem to regret not having done things much more than they regret things they did
- Although you might expect people to dislike anything associated with physical pain, the volunteers in the severe-initiation group actually liked the club more. Because these volunteers suffered greatly, the intensity of their suffering triggered their defensive systems, which immediately began working to help them achieve a credible and positive view of their experience.
- The irony is that you may ultimately feel better when you are the victim of an insult than when you are a bystander to it.
- Apparently, people are not aware of the fact that their defenses are more likely to be triggered by intense than mild suffering, thus they mispredict their own emotional reactions to misfortunes of different sizes.
- But another possibility is that we are more likely to look for and find a positive view of the things we’re stuck with than of the things we’re not.
- Apparently, inescapable circumstances trigger the psychological defenses that enable us to achieve positive views of those circumstances, but we do not anticipate that this will happen. Our failure to anticipate that inescapability will trigger our psychological immune systems (hence promote our happiness and satisfaction) can cause us to make some painful mistakes.
- loved one or a physical assault—can lead to surprising improvements in both subjective well-being and physical health
- people who experience the greatest benefit from these writing exercises are those whose writing contains an explanation of the trauma.
- Explanations allow us to understand how and why an event happened, which immediately allows us to see how and why it might happen again.
- Apparently, even a fake explanation can cause us to tuck an event away and move along to the next one.
- We expect the next car, the next house, or the next promotion to make us happy even though the last ones didn’t and even though others keep telling us that the next ones won’t.

The Intensity Trigger
- Psychological immune system is a defensive system
- When experience makes us unhappy, we shift blame and cook facts to offer a more positive view (but doesn’t do this every time) → usually for larger, more serious things
- Most of us believe that men are less emotional than women (“She cried, he didn’t”), that men and women have different emotional reactions to similar events (“He was angry, she was sad”), and that women are particularly prone to negative emotions at particular points in their menstrual cycles (“She’s a bit irritable today, if you know what I mean”). As it turns out, there is little evidence for any of these beliefs—but that’s not the point. The point is that these beliefs are theories that can influence how we remember our own emotions.
- It seems that our theories about how people of our gender usually feel can influence our memory of how we actually felt.
- Asian culture does not emphasize the importance of personal happiness as much as European culture does, and thus Asian Americans believe that they are generally less happy than their European American counterparts.
- First, on the day after the election, pro-Gore voters expected to be devastated and pro-Bush voters expected to be elated if George Bush was ultimately declared the winner. Second, when George Bush was ultimately declared the winner, pro-Gore voters were less devastated and pro-Bush voters were less elated than they had expected to be (a tendency you’ve seen before in other chapters). But third and most important, a few months after the election was decided, both groups of voters remembered feeling as they had expected to feel, and not as they had actually felt.
- Economists explain that wealth has “declining marginal utility,” which is a fancy way of saying that it hurts to be hungry, cold, sick, tired, and scared, but once you’ve bought your way out of these burdens, the rest of your money is an increasingly useless pile of paper.
- As Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, wrote in 1776: “The desire for food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniences and ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems to have no limit or certain boundary.”
- If you believe (as I do) that people can generally say how they are feeling at the moment they are asked, then one way to make predictions about our own emotional futures is to find someone who is having the experience we are contemplating and ask them how they feel.
- tendency to fill in and leave out without telling us (which we explored in the section on realism).
- Imagination’s second shortcoming is its tendency to project the present onto the future (which we explored in the section on presentism).
- Imagination’s third shortcoming is its failure to recognize that things will look different once they happen—in particular, that bad things will look a whole lot better (which we explored in the section on rationalization).
- don’t always see ourselves as superior, but we almost always see ourselves as unique
- We prize our unique identities, and research shows that when people are made to feel too similar to others, their moods quickly sour and they try to distance and distinguish themselves in a variety of ways.
- It was a good try. Bernoulli was right in thinking that the hundredth dollar (or kiss or doughnut or romp in the meadow) generally does not make us as happy as the first one did, but he was wrong in thinking that this was the only thing that distinguished wealth from utility and hence the only thing one must correct for when predicting utility from wealth.
