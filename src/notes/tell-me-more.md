"You can’t be really loved if you can’t bear to be really known."

- **Tell me more**
  - Instead of giving advice or trying to tell someone how to fix something, listen.
  - Sometimes what’s being said isn’t the actual issue.
  - Give space for someone to be heard
- **I don’t know**
  - Sometimes the best thing is to just recognize what we don’t know
  - Sometimes we don’t have an answer and that’s okay
  - There’s not always an answer, fix, or solution.
  - Sometimes we have to accept that something just _is_
- **I know**
  - Be candidly open with people
  - “You can’t _really_ be loved if you can’t bear to be _really_ known.”
  - Sometimes “I know” or “me too” is far more helpful that “I’m sorry”
  - The collective understanding or sympathy or feeling that someone else knows what we’re going through is all that’s necessary
- **No**
  - When you say “no” don’t complain and don’t explain - every excuse you make is like an invitation to ask you again in a different way
  - “Sometimes the art of the relationship is declaring your limits, protecting your boundaries, saying no.”
- **Yes**
