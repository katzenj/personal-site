- I love Voltaire’s observation that “History never repeats itself; man always does.” It applies so well to how we behave with money.
- Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
- Or, just be careful when assuming that 100% of outcomes can be attributed to effort and decisions.
- Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.
- The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.
- “Enough” is realizing that the opposite—an insatiable appetite for more—will push you to the point of regret.
- There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain.
- Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable. Family and friends are invaluable. Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable. Happiness is invaluable. And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough.
- More than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I’m unbreakable I actually think I’ll get the biggest returns, because I’ll be able to stick around long enough for compounding to work wonders.
- Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
- A barbelled personality—optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future—is vital.
- A good definition of an investing genius is the man or woman who can do the average thing when all those around them are going crazy. Tails drive everything.
- The most important economic events of the future—things that will move the needle the most—are things that history gives us little to no guide about. They will be unprecedented events.
- For my own investments, which I’ll describe more in chapter 20, I assume the future returns I’ll earn in my lifetime will be ⅓ lower than the historic average. So I save more than I would if I assumed the future will resemble the past. It’s my margin of safety. The future may be worse than ⅓ lower than the past, but no margin of safety offers a 100% guarantee. A one-third buffer is enough to allow me to sleep well at night. And if the future does resemble the past, I’ll be pleasantly surprised.
- To repeat a point we’ve made a few times in this book: The ability to do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want, has an infinite ROI.
- We should avoid the extreme ends of financial planning. Assuming you’ll be happy with a very low income, or choosing to work endless hours in pursuit of a high one, increases the odds that you’ll one day find yourself at a point of regret.
- A takeaway here is that few things matter more with money than understanding your own time horizon and not being persuaded by the actions and behaviors of people playing different games than you are. The main thing I can recommend is going out of your way to identify what game you’re playing.
- Growth is driven by compounding, which always takes time. Destruction is driven by single points of failure, which can happen in seconds, and loss of confidence, which can happen in an instant.
- Expecting things to be great means a best-case scenario that feels flat. Pessimism reduces expectations, narrowing the gap between possible outcomes and outcomes you feel great about.
- The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.
- Everyone has an incomplete view of the world. But we form a complete narrative to fill in the gaps.
