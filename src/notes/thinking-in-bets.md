## Introduction

- two things that determine how our lives turn out: the quality of our decisions and luck

### Pete Carroll and the Monday Morning QB

- Pete was the victim of our tendency to equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome

### Hazards of Resulting

- We link results with decisions even though it Is easy to point out indisputable examples where the relationships between decisions and results isn't so perfectly correlated
- **Quick or dead: our brains weren't built for rationality**
	- our brains evolved to create certainty and order
	- we are uncomfortable with the idea that luck plays a significant role in our lives
	- **type I error** → a false positive — incorrectly interpreting rustling from the wind as an oncoming lion is called a
	- **type II error** → a false negative — (could have been fatal) hearing resulting and always assuming its the wind would have gotten our ancestors eaten
	- **System 1** → fast thinking — "reflexive mind" — reflex, instinct, intuition, impulse, and automatic processing
	- **System 2** → slow thinking — "deliberative mind" — how we choose, concentrate, and expend mental energy

### Dr. Strangelove

- John von Neumann → father of game theory
	- _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_ → one of 100 most influential books of the century
- **Using Uncertainty to our Advantage**
	- getting comfortable with "I'm not sure" is a vital step to being a better decision-maker
	- we have to make peace with **_not knowing_**
	- a great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge
	- that state of knowledge is some variant of "I'm not sure"
	- "I'm not sure" is simply a more accurate representation of the world
	- when we accept that we can't be sure, we are less likely to fall into the trap of _black-and-white thinking_
	- when we think in advance about the chances of alternative outcomes and make a decision based on those chances, it doesn't automatically make us wrong when things don't work out → just means that one event in a set of possible futures occurred
	- losses in general feel about 2x as bad as wins feel good

## Ch. 2 Wanna Bet?

- Decisions and bets
	- whenever we choose an alternative, we are automatically rejecting every other possible choice
	- all of those rejected alternatives are paths to possible futures where things could be better or worse than the path we chose
	- there is potential opportunity cost in any choice we forgo
	- **our decisions are always bets**
	- Dan Gilbert and colleagues demonstrated that our default is to **believe** what we hear and read is true. **EVEN** when that info is clearly presented as being false, we are still likely to process it as true
- Bias
	- the better you are with numbers, the better you are at spinning those numbers to conform to and support your beliefs
	- being smart can make bias worse
	- better at recognizing bias in others but not in ourselves
- Belief & bias
	- when someone challenges us to **bet** on a belief, signaling their confidence that our belief is inaccurate in some way, ideally it triggers us to vet the belief, taking an inventory of the evidence that informed us
	- the order in which we form abstract beliefs:
		1. Hear something
		2. Believe it
		3. Only sometimes will we later think about it and vet it, determine whether or not it is true
	- "Wanna bet?" triggers us to engage in that third step
	- when we train ourselves to view the world through the lens of "wanna bet?", we are **more likely** to recognize
		- that there is always a degree of uncertainty
		- we are generally less sure than we though we were
		- that practically nothing is black and white, 0% or 100%
- Confidence
	- when confronted with new evidence, it is a very different to say, "I was 58% but now I'm 46%"
		- doesn't feel nearly as bad as "I though I was right but now I'm wrong"

## Ch. 3 Bet to Learn: Fielding the Unfolding Future

- Learning
	- **Betting on a future =** Belief → Bet → Set of outcomes
	- **Learning loop 1** = Belief → Bet → Outcome → Bet 2 → Belief → ...
	- **Learning loop 2** = Belief → Bet → Outcome → Luck **OR** Belief → Bet → Outcome → Skill → Belief → ...
	- learning from watching others is just as fraught with bias
		- we field the outcomes of our peers predictably
		- when they do well → it was luck
		- when they do poorly → they aren't good
	- getting insight into the way uncertainty trips us up, whether the errors we make are patterned (hint: they are) and what motivates those errors, should give us clues for figuring out achievable strategies to calibrate the bets we make on our outcomes
- Skill and luck
	- the way our lives turn out is the result of two things
		- influence of skill
		- influence of luck
	- outcomes are almost never 100% due to luck or skill
- Self-serving bias
	- **self-serving bias** → has immediate and obvious consequences for our ability to learn from experience
		- blaming the bulk of our bad outcomes on luck means we miss opportunities to examine our decisions to see where we can do better
	- We are motivated to updaet our self-image in a positive way → can end up using self-serving bias to do so
		- could stop clinging to ego → give up on the need to have a positive narrative of our lives
		- get off on striving to be more objective and open-minded in assessing the influence of luck and skill on our outcomes
		- put time and hard work to retrain the way we process results
	- **black-and-white thinking** → a driver of both motivated reasoning and self-serving bias
		- if our options are being 100% right or 100% wrong, then information that potentially contradicts a belief requires a total downgrade from _all the way right_ to _wrong_
	- we often don't even realize when we are in the echo chamber ourselves, because we're so in love with our own ideas that it all just sounds sensible and right
- Wanting to be better than others/self-serving propaganda
	- taking credit for a win lifts our personal narrative
		- so does knocking down a peer by finding them at fault for a loss
	- **schadenfreude** → deriving pleasure from someone else's misfortune
	- we'd rather lap the field in 1900 (by making $70,000), where conditions were much poorer, no modern medicine, and life expectancy of 40 than make $70,000 and be "average"
- Avoiding self-serving bias
	- we can learn better and be more open-minded if we work toward a positive narrative driven by engagement in truthseeking and striving toward accuracy and objectivity
		- giving others credit when it's due
		- admitting when our decisions could have been better
		- acknowledge that **almost nothing** is black and white
	- we should guard against gravitating toward clones of ourselves.
	- we should recognize that it's really hard; the norm is toward homogeneity (and we all do it)
- Seek outside perspective
	- the advice of experts in group interaction adds up to a pretty good blueprint for a truthseeking charter:
		1. a focus on accuracy (over confirmation)
				- rewards truthseeking, objectivity, and open-mindedness
		2. accountability
		3. openness to a diversity of ideas
	- to get a more objective view of the world, we need an environment that exposes us to alternate hypotheses and different perspectives
	- share data → one of the reasons experts become experts is because they understand that sharing data is the best way to move toward accuracy
- Using bets to examine belief accuracy
	- when we think in bets, we run through a series of questions to examine the accuracy of our beliefs
		- why might my belief not be true?
		- what other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief?
		- are there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true?
		- what sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief?
		- what are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what's their support, and why might they be right instead of me?
		- what other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did?
- Uncategorized
	- CUDOS → used to push a group toward objectivity
		- Communism
		- Universalism
		- Disinterestedness
		- Organized Skepticism
	- Merton → wrote about normative structure of science → makes an excellent career guide for anyone seeking to be a profitable decision-maker

### Universalism

- don't disparage or ignore an idea just because you don't like who or where it came from
- John Stuart Mill made it clear that the only way to gain knowledge and approach truth is by examining every variety of opinion.
	- We learn things we didn't know
	- We calibrate better
	- When the result of that examination confirms our initial position, we understand that position better if we open ourselves to every side of the issue

### Disinterestedness

- provide the outcome when seeking advice on the past for legitimate advice and not confirmation
- **Organized Skepticism**
	- We engage by saying "I'm not sure about that" or even "Are you sure about that?" or "Have you considered this other way of thinking about it?"
	- Uncertainty improves truthseeking within groups and also invites everyone around us to share helpful information and dissenting opinions
	- Lead with assent.
		- E.g. listen for the things you agree with, state those and be specific, and then follow with "and" instead of "but."
	- "And" is an offer to contribute, whereas "but" is a denial and repudiation of what came before

## Ch. 6 - Adventures in Mental Time Travel

- **Night Jerry**
	- When we make in-the-moment decisions (and don't consider the past/future OR second-order consequences), we are more likely to be irrational and impulsive
		- called **temporal discounting**
		- willing to take an irrationally large discount to get a reward now instead of waiting for a bigger reward later
	- AARP & other retirement savings management companies are using a tool that projects how you will look around retirement to help people make _better_ decisions about their futures
		- gets us to think about the consequences of our actions on our future selves
- **Moving regret in front of our decisions**
	- anticipating or contemplating regret **before** a decision helps us to get a sense of the regret we would feel afterwards and might lead to a different decision
	- imagine how we will feel when we make a decision → side note: interesting to consider when thinking about _Stumbling on Happiness_ and how we're pretty bad at imagining how we'll feel in the future
- **A flat tire, the ticker, and a zoom lens**
	- strive for long, sustaining upwards trend rather than being consumed by a temporary downward moment (e.g. like in stocks, we shouldn't become fearful and sell after 1 day, week or month of downward momentum, but focus on the trend over years)
	- the way we field outcomes is path dependent → to us, it matters more how we got there than where we end up
		- e.g. go to casino, lose $1000 in first hour and make it back in the 2nd hour to break even → probably very happy
		- go to casino and win $1000 in first hour, then lose $1000 in 2nd to break even → probably pretty sad
		- both situations have the same outcome but you're feeling better when ending on a better note
		- similarly works with ending the night up $100 (but having started up $1000 and lost $900) and losing $100 (starting down $1000 but making up $900) → more likely to be sad about the $100 gain and happy about the $100 loss because of the path
		- BUT, when we look back on it after a year, the results are likely reversed, because we're not affected by the emotions of the moment
- **Tilt**
	- bad outcomes basically cause you to become a bit unhinged and impede your decision-making in a way that results in more bad outcomes and so on and so forth
- **Ulysses contracts: time traveling to precommit**
	- how Ulysses recognized the danger of the island of the Sirens, and asked his sailors to tie his hands to the mast and plug his ears with beeswax
	- putting methods in place or procedures to reduce the likelihood that we act in a way that we would rather not (carrying healthy snacks to avoid getting something unhealthy when out)
- **Decision swear jar**
	- Example of things that trigger decision-interrupt:
		- I know
		- I’m sure
		- You’re 100% wrong
		- It’s black and white
		- There’s no way that’s true
		- Overconfidence
		- Irrational outcome fielding (I can’t believe how unlucky I got, I planned it perfectly)
		- Any moaning or complaining about bad luck just to off-load jt
		- Generalized characterizations of people meant to dismiss their ideas
		- Shooting the message because we don’t like the messenger
		- Zooming in on a single moment (e.g. day from hell)
		- Expressions that explicitly signal motivates reasoning (“if you ask anybody”)
		- The word “wrong”
		- Lack of self-compassion
		- Signals we’re being overly generous editors when we share a story
		- Infecting listeners with conflict of interest
		- Terms that discourage engagement of others and their opinions
- **Reconnaissance: mapping the future**
	- We shouldn’t plan our future without doing advance work on the range of futures that could result from any given decision
	- Betting on a future
		- Belief → Bet → Set(outcomes)
	- Best poker players think beyond the current hand (second order consequences)
		- What are the possible futures? What are their probabilities?
		- Don’t know exactly because they can’t see their opponents cards
	- Scenario planing reminds us that the future is inherently uncertain
	- Better prepared for how we’ll respond to certain outcomes
	- Keeps us from unproductive regret
- **Scenario planning in practice**
	- Think probabilistically → a $100,000 grant that a foundation expected to get 25% of the time has an _expected value_ of $25,000
	- $200,000 grant expected to get 10% of time or 10% chance of getting has _expected value_ of $20,000
- **Backcasting: working backward from a future positive**

	> A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step - Chinese proverb

	- It’s hard to see past the next step. We end up over planning for addressing problems we have right now.
	- Identify goal and work backward to “remember” how we got there
	- Can identify low probability events that are necessary to reach a goal → can the optimize to improve the probability it occurs
- **Premortems: working backward from a negative future**
	- Negative form of backcasting → imagine negative future and how we got there
	- Makes us more likely to achieve our goals
- **Dendrology and hindsight bias**
	- Imagine time as a tree where the ever growing trunk is the past, where the trunk meets the branches is the present, and all of the branches are the future (thinner are less probabilistic where thicker are more probabilistic)
	- As we grow, we take a chainsaw to every branch that we don’t take, making the tree look like one long trunk when looking at the past
	- This means we’re more susceptible to hindsight bias. We can’t tell that an action with 2-3% failure rate had that low of probability. To us it looks like “ugh I should’ve known that would happen” or “of course that was gonna happen”
