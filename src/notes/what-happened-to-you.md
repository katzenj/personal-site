## Highlights

We also have sensory systems that tell us what is going on inside our body. This is called interoception, and it creates our sense of, for instance, being thirsty, hungry, or short of breath.

Yes, it’s exactly the opposite. The younger you are, the more you depend upon your caregivers—parents and other adults—to help you interpret the world. In some ways, the young child experiences the world through the filters of these adults.

In a young child, the cortex is not yet fully developed; in children younger than three, the neural networks are not mature enough to create what’s called linear narrative memory (in other words, a who, what, when, and where memory). However, in lower areas of the brain, other neural networks are processing—and changing as a result of—our earliest experiences. Associations, or memories, are being created in these lower networks, and this has a huge impact on how trauma is stored in the brains of the very young.

If a child experiences abuse, their brain may make an association between the features of the abuser or the circumstances of the abuse—hair color, tone of voice, the music playing in the background—and a sense of fear. The complex and confusing associations can influence behaviors for years; later in life, for example, being served in a restaurant by a brown-haired man who hovers over you while he takes your order may elicit a panic attack.

On the show, rabbi and family therapist M. Gary Neuman told me that for most children, divorce is really like a death. He explained that children don’t see their parents as separate people who came together. They see one parent unit within one family unit. So even if divorce is what’s best for the family overall, the children feel pieces of themselves being torn away.

And if one parent is no longer available, or suddenly introduces a new relationship to the dynamic before the child can develop trust, it impacts the areas of the brain involved in shaping self-worth.

Sam’s story illustrates so much about how the brain stores memory. Both Sam and I had experiences earlier in life where our brains made memories connected to the smell of Old Spice. My associations elicited positive feelings; his elicited distress and fear. As we make our way through the world, countless sounds, smells, and images can tap into memories we created earlier in life. These memories may be full-blown recollections of a specific event, or they may be fragments—a feeling, a sense of déjà vu, an impression.

It’s why we rock babies when they cry. We’re trying to help them find their own rhythm to help calm them down.

We elicit from the world what we project into the world; but what you project is based upon what happened to you as a child.

Imagine a situation where you are too small to win a fight and unable to run away. In this case, the brain and the rest of the body prepare for injury. Your heart rate goes down. You release your body’s own painkiller—opioids. You disengage from the external world and psychologically flee into your inner world. Time seems to slow. You may feel like you are in a movie, or floating and watching things happen to you. This is all part of another adaptive capability, called dissociation.

The healthiest way to do this is through relationships. Connectedness regulates and rewards us. Yet when substance abuse is involved, it can push loved ones away. And many interventions used to deal with substance abuse are punitive and increase distress. The pull to use gets stronger. Disconnection, marginalization, demonizing, and punishing only make the problems of substance abuse worse. The cycle of dysregulation, self-medication, relational disruption, lack of reward leads to more substance abuse. And the spiral continues.

For people who are pretty well-regulated, whose basic needs have been met, who have other healthy forms of reward, taking a drug will have some impact, but the pull to come back and use again and again is not as powerful.

Addiction is complex. But I believe that many people who struggle with drug and alcohol abuse are actually trying to self-medicate due to their developmental histories of adversity and trauma.

Oprah: It’s interesting to hear you say that, because I know lots of people who take drugs for their anxiety, whereas I have found medications like that just put me to sleep. Because my internal baseline is already so calm, when I take something that’s supposed to just relax me, I doze off. Dr. Perry: Right. You probably have friends who take the same amount that puts you to sleep.

Connectedness counters the pull of addictive behaviors. It is the key.

This principle of “specificity” applies to all brain-mediated functions, including the capacity to love. If you have never been loved, the neural networks that allow humans to love will be undeveloped, as in Gloria’s case. The good news is that with use, with practice, these capabilities can emerge. Given love, the unloved can become loving.

Our earliest developmental experiences, particularly touch and other relational-based sensory cues, including the caregiver’s smell and the way they rock the infant, the songs they hum when feeding the infant, any unique movement in the way they respond to the infant when it’s needy—all of these things are organizing experiences that help create the infant’s “worldview,” the “codebook” we talked about earlier.

For example, moderate, predictable, and controllable activation of our stress-response systems leads to a more flexible, stronger stress-response capability (see Figure 3) that lets a person demonstrate resilience in the face of more extreme stressors. It’s kind of like weight lifting for our stress-response systems;

Connectedness has the power to counterbalance adversity.

Our second major finding is that the timing of adversity makes a huge difference in determining overall risk. Put simply, if you experience trauma at age two, it will have more impact on your health than the same trauma taking place at age seventeen.

When I read about the principal who would not put chains on the doors, I had an Aha. The cans on my grandmother’s door sent the very message the principal was trying to avoid sending to his young students. The chains would perhaps have protected the children, but in the principal’s mind, it was more damaging to constantly remind them of a traumatic incident and make them believe they were unsafe. I finally connected the dots as to why I was afraid to be home alone at night. The attack on my grandmother, while we were asleep and at our most vulnerable, had been traumatizing. Obviously it left deep emotional scars. Even as an adult, as I tried to sleep, my mind was conditioned to stay in a constant state of arousal, prepared for attack.

I also knew that fear inhibits many cortical systems, in effect shutting them down; this includes those involved in narrative memory (see Figure 11). Joseph would never be able to give me any useful information if he didn’t feel safe.

There had been a dozen “episodes” of interaction; those systems didn’t really register that these were all part of the same four-hour visit.

In order to communicate rationally and successfully with anyone, you have to make sure they’re regulated, make sure they feel a relationship with you, and only then try to reason with them.

It’s the same thing with relationships. If you familiarize with one person for six weeks and then they disappear and a new person starts caring for you, and then that person disappears, and so on, your infant brain hasn’t had sufficient repetitions with any single person to create the architecture that allows you to develop healthy relational neurobiology.

It has the same effect. And other children will discover that pulling out their hair or their eyebrows gives a little bit of an opiate burst.

Children will find a way to soothe. Making yourself throw up can also cause that opioid burst. So there are eating disorders related to “self-soothing” and not to body image. It’s a maladaptive form of soothing.

I have teachers and foster parents tell me, “He almost acts like he wants to get punished.” And, to a certain extent, they’re right. He is seeking a predictable response from the world. And predictable, for him, means being punished, excluded, minimized. He is looking for evidence that his worldview is accurate:

Us-and-them is deeply ingrained in our neurobiology; it’s what makes connectedness a double-edged sword. We are strongly connected to our clan, but not so much to other clans—we compete with them for limited resources.

The actual best indicators of change in the brain following trauma or neglect are “functional” changes: Is the child impulsive or inattentive? Do they have speech and language problems or fine-motor-control issues? Are they depressed or anxious? Do they have a hard time learning? Can they form and maintain healthy relationships? All of these things are much better indicators of changes in the brain than brain scans are.

A child in an environment where they feel loved and safe will choose to leave their comfort zone. Safe and familiar is “boring”; a safe and stable child is a curious child—they want to explore new things.

Our brain processes incoming sensory input from the bottom up (see Figures 2 and 10), and if someone has a life with chaotic, uncontrollable, or extreme and prolonged stress, particularly early in life, they’re more likely to act before thinking. Their cortex is not as active, and reactivity in the lower areas of the brain becomes more dominant.

Yes, it’s best if you can simply be present. If you do use words, it’s best to restate what they’re saying; this is called reflective listening. You can’t talk someone out of feeling angry, sad, or frustrated, but you can be a sponge and absorb their emotional intensity. If you stay regulated, ultimately they will “catch” your calm.

From that point forward, a major component of Mike’s therapy was “physical therapy.” Several times a week he would get massages for his “bad back.” I encouraged him to dance in smaller doses all week long, and to walk. He started walking all over town. A month or so after creating a more structured schedule of rhythmic activities, he began sleeping much better. And his other post-traumatic symptoms started to be less intrusive.

And it’s especially regulating if you can walk in nature. The sensory elements of the natural world bathe us with their own regulating rhythms.

Let’s keep talking about how you can help a dysregulated person feel more regulated. Instead of saying, Hey, tell me what you’re thinking about, you need to let them control when and how much they’re going to talk about what’s upsetting them. If you give a person that control and help them feel safe, in their own time they will be more capable of talking.

The pillars of traditional healing were 1) connection to clan and the natural world; 2) regulating rhythm through dance, drumming, and song; 3) a set of beliefs, values, and stories that brought meaning to even senseless, random trauma; and 4) on occasion, natural hallucinogens or other plant-derived substances used to facilitate healing with the guidance of a healer or elder.

Think of the diversity within a small multifamily, multigenerational clan. Children growing up had numerous adults and older children who could model, teach, nurture, discipline, and care for them. Each person in the clan had a unique set of strengths—the right person at the right time.

This is incredibly unlike our modern world. We expect a single working mother to be the one to throw the baseball with her eight-year-old, rock the newborn, read to the three-year-old, and, by the way, cook a nutritious meal, help with homework, do the laundry, get everyone to bed, then wake up and get them all ready for childcare and school so she can go work all day, only to rush home to do it all again. All alone.

Note:Like how we cant rely on our partner to be everything

You have created a controllable and moderate revisiting of the distressing review, and that has changed your reaction to it. It is no longer as distressing. Originally you were dysregulated, you shut down the “rational” part of your head, distorted the comments, magnified them. But now you can reflect more accurately on the feedback, and maybe see some truth in the comments. That wasn’t possible until you could use your many relational interactions to revisit and regulate.

Yes. Unfortunately, our schools are typically not trauma-aware and tend to prohibit many of the regulatory activities we’ve mentioned: walking, rocking, fiddling with things while listening to a lesson, listening to music with your earbuds while doing homework. “Somatosensory regulation,” such as the rhythmic activities we have discussed, actually opens up the cortex and makes the reasoning parts of the brain more accessible for learning.

Ideally, you go out into the community and spend time with people who are different than you are. You need to create real, meaningful relationships so that you get to know individuals based on their unique qualities, not based on categories. Oprah: That’s what really changes both implicit bias and racism. Dr. Perry: Exactly.

And this is why you can’t be in a corporation and address these issues by simply having everyone go to an anti-racism course or cultural-sensitivity training. You don’t get trained in cultural sensitivity—you go spend time immersed in the culture, spend time with other people.

Conversation, for example, promotes resilience; discussions and arguments over family dinners and mildly heated conversations with friends are—as long as there is repair—resilience-building and empathy-growing experiences. We shouldn’t be walking away from a conversation in a rage; we should regulate ourselves. Repair the ruptures. Reconnect and grow. When you walk away, everybody loses. We all need to get better at listening, regulating, reflecting.

In our work, we find that the best predictor of your current mental health is your current “relational health,” or connectedness.

Many people have had the experience of feeling “exhausted” after a day of travel, even if all they did was stand in a few lines and sit on a plane. This happens because your brain was continuously monitoring thousands of new stimuli. Remember: Activating your stress-response systems, even at a moderate level, for long periods of time is physically and emotionally exhausting.

But it’s simply unhealthy for a three-or four-year-old child to go eight hours without touching or hugging or playfully wrestling with another person.

Her self-mutilation, as we have talked about before, was an attempt to regulate herself. In the face of unavoidable pain and distress, she dissociated—hence her staring spells. And the arousal component of her stress response was also sensitized (see Figure 5): Her temper tantrums were the toddler’s equivalent of the flight-or-fight response. This was a terrified, confused, undeveloped child.

The fascinating thing is that we ended up using many of the same therapeutic methods that had previously failed. There hadn’t been anything inherently “wrong” with the prior methods—they were simply applied at a time when Susan couldn’t benefit from them. Neurosequential. It’s all about the sequence. The brain develops, processes incoming sensory input, and heals in sequence.
