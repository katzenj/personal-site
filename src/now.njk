    Working on finding meaning. We'll see how that goes. I'm currently a Product Engineer and tech lead of the Customer Experience team at Settle.

    I am running and raising money for <a href="https://www.achillesinternational.org/" class="underline" target="_blank">Achilles International</a>.
    Please <a class="italic underline" target="_blank" href="https://give.achillesinternational.org/jordan">donate</a> and support
    athletes with disabilities in their training and in getting to the start (and finish) line!
