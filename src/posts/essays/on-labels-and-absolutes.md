Recently, I've been thinking about how often we throw around labels and absolutes. They're everywhere—"She's a vegan," "I'm a foodie," "I'd never tolerate that," you name it. We lean on these shortcuts to express who we are and what we think, but we don't often stop to consider how they shape our opinions, self-perceptions, and how others see us.

Labels push us toward black-and-white thinking and influence our opinions. Absolutes limit us to all-or-nothing views, ignoring the messy spectrum most of us actually live on. Reflecting on our language and its implications can help us better understand how we subtly affect ourselves and those around us.

## Labels
Labels form the foundation for many aspects of our lives. Vegetarian, minimalist, anxious, introvert, perfectionist—these words influence what we buy (or don't), how we judge others, and even how we act. ("What would a minimalist do in this situation?")

If I label myself as "Catholic," there's a set of beliefs that *generally* come with that—beliefs about personal conduct or history. Without unpacking everything tied to the "Catholic" label, I might hold certain beliefs simply because of the label, not because I've thought them through. Depending on how strongly I identify with the label, I might even feel disinclined to explore alternatives.

### Binaries and Assumed Opinions
One issue is that labels often split things into two sides—introvert vs. extrovert, conservative vs. liberal, minimalist vs. not, vegetarian vs. meat-eater—without acknowledging that most of us exist somewhere in the messy middle.

Let's use politics as an example (fun, right!). The graphic below shows my rough depiction of the U.S. political spectrum compared to what it looks like when we use labels like Democrat and Republican.

This oversimplifies where one can exist on the political spectrum and also sets up a "them vs. us" mentality. When we hear someone mention their political party, we make assumptions about their views, lifestyle, and personality—even if we know nothing else about them.

We also assume beliefs based on how we label ourselves. Let's say you're a first-time voter. You come across names you don't recognize on the ballot. Luckily, you know you're a Democrat, so when it's Democrat vs. Republican, it's an easy choice. However, the candidate you choose may have extreme views on several issues that you don't agree with. The other candidate could've been quite moderate, but you don't notice because, well, it's Democrat vs. Republican and as a Democrat, you can't imagine voting for a Republican. I overheard that exact sentiment recently when someone said, "It was kind of a close race, but I couldn't bring myself to vote for a Republican."

That was a charged example, but the same applies to introversion vs. extroversion. We assume the introvert must be shy and reserved or the extrovert is gregarious and outgoing. You might label yourself as an introvert because you're shy and then start to assume other introvert attributes without considering what that truly means. Maybe you're shy but actually get energized from small social gatherings (which would mean you might be higher on the extraversion scale than you thought). You can exist somewhere in the middle of the spectrum! It's not an either-or.

Labels make things appear binary when they're not. The core issue is how we allow labels to guide our thinking without doing due diligence.

### Closed-mindedness

Labels can subtly prevent us from exploring new territories and interests. Take my experience in early 2022. I had proudly labeled myself as an "outdoorsy" guy who enjoyed camping. But after a few trips, reality hit: camping wasn't really my thing. Sure, I loved certain aspects—campfire meals, seeing shooting stars, morning coffee and eggs—but these pleasures were overshadowed by less romantic elements (like my persistent fear of becoming bear food and my genuine hatred for bugs).
When I finally admitted to my girlfriend that I didn't actually enjoy camping, something interesting happened. She started mentioning this fact to others during camping conversations, and I'd immediately jump to defend myself, insisting that I did enjoy it. What was happening? I was struggling with the dissonance between my self-imposed "camping guy" label and my authentic feelings.

This attachment to a label prevented me from being open-minded about what I truly enjoyed. Once I finally dropped the "camping guy" identity (though kept the "outdoorsy" part—baby steps), I felt free-er. I could honestly say, "Yeah, some aspects are fun, but unless conditions are perfect, I probably won't be camping anytime soon."

This camping example might sound trivial—how could someone cling to a label that doesn't bring them joy? But I had invested in an identity around camping and related activities. I thought I should enjoy it. I wanted to be that person, so I tried forcing it to work. Maintaining this facade took more energy than simply letting go of the label would have.

Labels aren't all-controlling, but they can become invisible barriers—preventing us from exploring new opportunities, considering different viewpoints, and imagining what life might be like if we loosened their grip.

### It's not all bad though

Labels can create community and foster belonging. They can provide purpose and orient us toward something positive. "Everybody (every body) is an athlete" is one powerful example. The "athlete" label can transform how we view ourselves.

The value of community—when positive—cannot be overstated. As a "runner," you can find your people through running clubs or social media. As a "Catholic," you connect through church or related activities. When minimalism was trending (or was that just me in my minimalist echo chamber?), people who embraced the "minimalist" label found a supportive community of like-minded individuals. This community lifted each other up as they decluttered their lives and navigated the opinions of others. Feeling connected to people with shared values is fundamentally important. Labels can help us discover those communities that enrich our lives.

Still, we need to acknowledge potential consequences and remember that labels aren't fixed. We can adopt new ones or shed old ones as we evolve. Keep an open mind and question assumptions without proper investigation. Above all, we should be more mindful of our language and how labels shape everyone's experience.

## Absolutes
As mentioned earlier, I had two observations: our use of labels and absolutes. Now let's explore absolutes.

I define an absolute statement as one that leaves no room for nuance—it's binary, 0 or 1, yes or no, 0% or 100%. They're easy to spot with words like "never" and "always." You've heard them: "You never take out the trash" or "You always get to pick the movie we watch." Could it be that you have literally never taken out garbage or have selected every single film? Possible, but unlikely. The speaker probably meant "You rarely take out the trash" or "You pick almost every movie." I might be splitting hairs, but this distinction matters.

There are few situations where we truly mean 0% or 100%. Sometimes, these absolutes create self-fulfilling prophecies.

Imagine you went vegan a couple years ago. You share the benefits with friends (only when asked—you're not that vegan who won't shut up about it) and have declared, "I will never eat meat again; being vegan is too important for my health and the planet." Now, you're experiencing fatigue and other health issues. Your doctor and nutritionist suggest adding fish and red meat to address vitamin deficiencies. Yikes. You're in a bind.
What do you do? Since it's your health, you should probably follow medical advice. But your ego might recoil at telling friends you're no longer vegan. After all, you've repeatedly announced you would "never eat meat again." This scenario might sound contrived, but I've witnessed similar situations unfold.

In most cases, statements like "I will never eat meat again" won't dramatically impact your life. But such definitive proclamations can lead to certain choices or create conflict with people who view things differently. Declarations like "I would never do that" aren't particularly useful either. Sure, some examples exist where this holds true, but we casually throw these phrases around when someone makes a work mistake, wears an outfit we dislike, or when we insist we'd never run a marathon (until we do—speaking from experience).

Statements like "I don't like," "I love," or "I hate" also fall under the absolutes umbrella. They're less intense than "always" or "never," but convey similar rigidity. To be clear, having preferences is perfectly fine—I'm focused on when they prevent us from trying new experiences.
A personal example: I once thought (and probably said aloud), "I wouldn't like SoulCycle because I enjoy regular biking." Had I stuck with that statement without trying it, I might have missed a potentially enjoyable experience. Spoiler: I eventually tried it, and it wasn't for me. But that assumption became an excuse to decline my girlfriend's invitations for months.

We do this with food constantly. Of course, there are legitimate reasons people dislike certain foods—textures, flavors, past experiences—but our tastes evolve. How often do we hear "I don't like sushi" or "I don't like mushrooms"? Maybe you'll dislike mushrooms forever, and that's perfectly reasonable. But what if there's a mushroom dish out there you'd enjoy? Openness to new experiences plays a role here, but so does the language we use around preferences.

Here's a slightly odd example: I've never liked raw oysters. Yet almost every time I eat with someone who orders them, I'll try one—thinking, "Maybe this time will be different." So far, it hasn't happened (except for that fried oyster smothered in garlic and parmesan). But I recognize that tastes change, so I'll keep trying oysters when the opportunity arises.

I'm not suggesting we stop "always" and "never," or stop expressing likes and dislikes. Some situations warrant absolutes: "I will never live on Pluto" seems reasonable enough (though "I will never live on Mars may not be..."). Preferences aren't the issue—it's how we carve them in stone that creates problems. It would be ridiculous to qualify everything with asterisks like "I don't like mushrooms... right now." While I agree with the sentiment, such specificity isn't practical. As with labels, the key is maintaining an open mind.

## Finit

What I hope you take away is the value of an open mind paired with a healthy dose of skepticism. Labels and absolutes will always (ha) have their place in language. Labels can oversimplify our complex world and others' perspectives. They can cause us to blindly adopt views we haven't personally examined. Yet they can also foster community and create shared experiences. Absolutes influence our decisions through self-fulfilling prophecies or stubborn adherence despite contradictory evidence.

By maintaining openness, recognizing the limitations of labels and absolutes, and showing empathy when others use them, we can all become better versions of ourselves—more nuanced, more understanding, and ultimately more human.
