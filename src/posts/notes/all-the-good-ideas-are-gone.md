There are no more good ideas. There, I said it. Everything's been done before.

Like many software engineers in Silicon Valley, I've contemplated starting my own company. Not in any real way involving an actual product or service—just the vague notion that I *should* because that's what everyone does, right?

I never thought I had the ability until an old manager made a joking, off-hand comment after I put in my notice. They said that when I started my company, they wanted to work there. It was likely post-IPO euphoria talking, but it was the first time someone had expressed confidence in my potential to build something. It was the first time I even considered that as a path.

I followed what I'd consider a semi-normal path. At The University of Texas, many classmates landed software engineering internships at well-known companies: IBM, Bazaarvoice, Google, and others. I lucked into a couple internships and figured I'd follow the same trajectory: get my software engineering job, work up the ranks, probably move to management (because that's what everyone does, right?), and then make money.

After my manager's comment, I started believing in my capabilities. Of course, being capable of starting something differs dramatically from being capable of building a successful business. I could start a business right now—I'm just pre-revenue, pre-product-market-fit, and, well, pre-product. I'm even pre-idea.

I began dedicating time to ideation--a fancy way of saying I occasionally sat down to think of startup ideas for five minutes. What problems existed? How could I solve them? Were there markets for these solutions? I'd go on runs or bike rides without headphones, focusing solely on generating product ideas. Unfortunately, most of my concepts are really features—small components of larger products. Or they're vague improvements like "better Goodreads" without defining characteristics. My "Spark File" contains countless such ideas: a text-to-blog platform, a Raycast extension for time tracking, "Bits and Bites" (a newsletter combining bread recipes and software engineering content), a film development kiosk, a reading/media tracker like Beli, and more. 

Clearly, I shouldn't quit my day job. But what I've realized is that I'm approaching this backward. I'm fixated on the idea of being a founder rather than solving meaningful problems. I “need” to care about the end goal or product.

Silicon Valley's culture and social media echo chambers make it seem like everyone's launching successful startups. When I see headlines about Cursor, an AI code editor raising $100 million from twenty-something founders, I feel like I must be failing. After all, I haven't started anything and have a net worth of $10.

Maybe one day I'll find a problem I truly care about and a solution I believe in building. But probably not, and that's okay. I can continue building my Goodreads Visualizer and random side projects, enjoying the process. It's not all about making it big or maximizing profits. Besides, all the good ideas are gone.
