There's a parable derived from "The Star Thrower" by Loren Eiseley about an old man who comes across a boy throwing living starfish back into the ocean. The beach is littered with thousands of starfish that wouldn't otherwise make it back into the water. The old man questions how the boy can make a difference when there are thousands of starfish stranded on the beach. The boy responds that he can make a difference to "that one." While the original essay differs—there is no young boy and no clear dialogue explaining the message—the core meaning remains: one person can make a difference.

This reminds me of the phrase "leave it better than you found it," attributed to the founder of the scouting movement. The phrase is a call to action to make a small difference wherever you are. You can almost always leave things better than you found them. Sure, this applies to picking up trash on the trail or saving a sand dollar stranded on the beach, but it also applies to our work lives: whether it's cleaning up code, building team culture, or praising someone for their contributions. You can make a change! You can see an issue in your bugs channel that goes unassigned and bring it up. You can spot potential issues in a proposal and raise them. You can see that people on the team are unhappy and suggest fixes. Maybe I'm stretching the message, but I operate on the belief that I can create change, no matter how small. 

If you have the capacity to fix something or even just get the ball rolling, why wouldn't you? While people often have valid concerns about taking action, there's usually a way to take that first step. It could be confiding in a trusted person, raising an issue with your manager, bringing up concerns anonymously or publicly—there are levels to it. But you can often move the needle just by taking a small step.

"Leave it better than you found it" is just one version of this “you can make a difference” mentality and it's the version I like the most (maybe because it's pithy). Change doesn't have to be big or done on some grand scale. Just because it doesn't feel significant doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Whether it's breaking down boxes that your neighbors left in the recycling room or fixing issues in code you found along the way. These aren't groundbreaking changes. It's simply about being the kind of person who takes initiative and works to leave things better than they found them.
