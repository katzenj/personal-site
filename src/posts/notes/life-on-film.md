I'm a professional hobby trier. I don't often stick with them--I get obsessed for a bit and then move on. So of course, when my friend offered to sell me his film point-and-shoot camera, I said why not. I bought the camera and a few rolls of film thinking I'd be starting my film photography Instagram account and racking up thousands of followers in no time.

The thing is, I'm not really someone who takes many pictures. I'm probably the last person my friends would think of to pick up photography as a hobby. I'm not even sure how I've done it can be considered a hobby. But the intentionality behind film and the limited number of shots per roll appealed to me.

Roughly two years after buying the camera, I used up a whopping three rolls of film (36 exposures each). $57 later (expensive, but the turnaround was quick), I had my pictures processed and digitally scanned. After thinking I had been robbed at the register, I thought it might be time to put the camera away for good. But then I got them back, and they turned out so well! Each picture brings back memories and feelings from those moments in such a fun way. The imperfections and occasional grainy photo make it even more fun.

Anyway, here are a few of my favorites.
