My mind is mush from biking 102 miles today (can someone tell me how the pros do it?), so this is going to be a short one about the Giro d’Italia of all things. If you’re not into cycling, some things (General Classification, the Giro, Pogi, …) won’t make sense! But I’d give ‘em a quick search or ChatGPT or whatever if necessary.

I won’t go into too much detail, so the short of it is that I got into cycling, watched season one of “Unchained” (the Netflix cycling version of F1’s Drive to Survive), and got hooked. Watching Pogi and Vingegaard duke it out was unreal. 

I have a soft spot for Jonas and loved the team so I just chose Visma as my team of choice, though really I root for riders (Jonas Vingegaard, Mads Pederson, Pogi at times, Carapaz, Neilson Powless, Matteo Jorgenson, etc.). Also, while I don’t like or want to support UAE as a team, it was fun, for a time, to watch Isaac Del Toro.

Anyway, this year’s Giro has been pretty great, especially without Pogi destroying the field. There was a solid and fairly close top-5 before today’s stage, and some fun battles across first, second, and third. There were several great stage wins by big names like Wout and lesser-known guys who deserve it like Carlos Verona (a long-time helper who won his first major stage). 

But today… today was a thing of beauty. Watching Simon Yates (Team Visma), who was down like 1:20 (a minute twenty) going into today’s stage, attack, take a small lead, and end up putting like five minutes into Del Toro (the leader) to effectively win the Giro… chef’s kiss. And the moment Yates linked up with Wout after the Colle delle Finestre… wow. I didn’t get to watch that part cause I was on a bike ride, but I re-watched the stage starting at the attack and then the highlights. Absolute madness. 

Following sports is an interesting thing. It’s a whirlwind of emotions—the highs when your team/person wins, the lows when they don’t, and the swings when you have no idea what’ll happen. But it’s so much fun to watch some of the cycling races like the Strade Bianchi, the Giro, and the Tour de France (and yes I know there many other races—I’ve tried to watch them, but struggle to get into it). You can root for multiple people to place in different ways, whether it’s the sprint jersey, the climb jersey, the leader jersey, or one of the other jerseys depending on the race. And then in TDF, there are even other factors like the team GC vs individual GC.

It’s fun to be able to cheer on different people and to learn about race tactics—today I learned that UAE didn’t seem to have any!

But yeah I guess this is sort of like an ode to the Giro, which will be coming to an end tomorrow when it finishes in Rome. Thanks for making the past three weeks fun, even if it means waking up early to only catch the last third of the stage. Cannot wait for the Tour de France this year to (hopefully) see Jonas vs. Pogi in full form.
