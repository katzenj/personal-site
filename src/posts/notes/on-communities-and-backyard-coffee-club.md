I've been thinking a lot about community—both fostering and creating it. Not just groups that hang out sometimes, but communities where people show up consistently because they're genuinely excited about the shared purpose that brings them together. Last year, my roommates and I ran a small experiment in community building: we hosted what I wanted to call "Backyard Coffee Club" at our place in SF—though because we hosted a single event, I'm not sure it can be called a “Club."

The setup was simple: we put our coffee gear in the backyard, bought some Costco croissants, and invited friends over for pour-overs and French press coffee on a cool San Francisco morning. Our friends loved it. They lined up for their coffee orders, hung out, and chatted around our backyard. Classic San Francisco stuff (or maybe classic Richmond stuff). But despite the great turnout and joy we got from hosting it… we never did it again.

This got me thinking about what community really means and why some communities thrive while others fizzle out.

The easy answer for us would be "life got in the way." Between three busy roommates with active social lives and travel schedules, finding another "perfect" weekend was difficult. But I think the real reason (other than it not being a priority) was that we had no compelling reason to make it happen again.

Here's what I mean: Backyard Coffee Club was fun, but it was just... coffee and hanging out. Don't get me wrong—I love both of those things. But the sustainable communities I see aren't built on casual hangouts alone. They're built on shared purpose.

Run clubs and founder meetups have a specific purpose or aligned goal—something like Marina Run Club is explicitly a social (i.e.: dating) run club that has done very well. South Park Commons is, according to their website, "a community of builders, technologists, and domain experts that challenge you, encourage you, and help you build and validate your ideas." Aka they have a specific purpose!

This sent me down a rabbit hole of examining my own interests—cycling, reading, learning, building software—and wondering what kind of community could emerge from (or really be created from) them. I've tried the usual routes: book clubs (which fell apart because we couldn't agree on books), cycling groups (plenty exist in SF, but they're either too casual or too hardcore for me), and tech meetups. Maybe I'm too picky and/or not open enough to trying these groups. After all, I'm judging them based on what I've heard and have never actually tried joining say a Fat Cake morning ride or applying to South Park Commons. But maybe there's merit to my desire to craft the community that I want to be part of.

My friend and I philosophize a lot—sometimes it's existential anxiety about AI and what it means for us, other times it's about work and the idea of a career. It's not something I'd want to do every day cause it can be intense, but how do you find a group of people who are willing to philosophize like that? To meet up, grab coffee/tea, and discuss some set of philosophical questions? I actually asked Claude what the word for that is and Claude told me that a “symposium" is akin to what I was thinking about. Unfortunately, that sounds unbelievably pretentious and may not draw the crowd I'm not interested in attracting. What I want is sort of like an elevated, focused version of "shooting the shit."

Maybe that's the seed of something interesting—a casual philosophy club without the pretense, or a "Pastry Cycling Club" that combines cycling with what I do too much of (eat pastries mid-ride). Both ideas have a clear purpose beyond just hanging out. Sure, odds are I'll be the only member of either group, but that's got to be better than just theorizing about the perfect community forever. 

I guess this is my way of talking myself into actually trying. We'll see what happens.
