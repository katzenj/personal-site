This was first called "on toil," but let me tell you &mdash; it has absolutely nothing to do with "working hard or incessantly." Instead, it's all about the power of tinkering, or as I like to call it, "snacking." It's similar to some of the ideas behind Atomic Habits too. How can you break something down into an achievable piece you can do consistently? Over time you can continue to build on that, but you start small.

My favorite Instagram follow, [Joe Holder](https://www.instagram.com/joeholder), coined the term “exercise snacks.” They're — and I might butcher this — small chunks (think 5-15 minutes) of exercises that you can do at home or on the go. Exercise snacks help beginners ease into fitness and experienced people knock out exercises even when time is limited. It’s all about reducing the scope to achieve the primary goal &mdash; staying active and healthy.

I've found that the same principle applies to side projects too. Instead of tackling big, intimidating ideas (though let's be real, none of my ideas are that big — most of my ideas are features, not products), I've focused more on "coding snacks," small, bite-sized projects that I can complete in short bursts. It's the difference between starting on a Goodreads alternative and working on a simple TUI app. I could just break down the Goodreads project into smaller chunks and work on it that way, but I enjoy working on different side projects or tasks to keep me motivated and learn new technologies. "Coding snacks" keep me motivated, build consistency, and help me make progress even on the days when I'm short on time.

I'm doing the same thing with writing. I started an “advent of writing” with a minimum of 250 words a day. It doesn't take long to achieve, but often with writing (and coding), I never start because writing an essay or starting a project seem like they’ll take a lot of time and I only have 30 minutes here or there.

Ideally, I can parlay these snacks into a real side project I care about (or potentially a larger essay with writing). But, while I’m thinking about ideas and exploring, snacking allows me to stay consistent even if I haven't figured out what I want to build yet.

The beauty of snacking is that it keeps me moving forward without the pressure of tackling everything at once. Who knows what, if anything, will come of these snacks, but it's fun right now. So, here's to snacking &mdash; may our small bites lead to big changes.
