Time is a mother. I stole the phrase from Ocean Vuong's book of the same name. While I don’t know what he meant by it, I think of it as “time is a motherf***er”. Time builds and destroys, heals and rips apart. We don’t have enough of it. Sometimes we have too much of it.

My dog passed three-and-a-half years ago. I lost my grandfather a year later. Life kept flying by. I completed an Ironman 70.3 a year and a half ago, ran the 2024 NYC Marathon six months ago, and got married two months ago. And now we’re almost halfway through 2025? Those were just a few cherry-picked events. I’m lucky and in disbelief that so much else has happened since 2021.

I think of time in phases. Sometimes they're more concrete than others—a six-month training block or time between two events. This year exists in phases distinguished by key events. The first phase was the six weeks leading up to my wedding. The second phase was (coincidentally also about six weeks) between the wedding and honeymoon. The third was short—the week between getting back from the honeymoon and moving apartments. The fourth is the brief blip between moving and a family trip. And so on it goes.

When I think about it that way, it always feels like there’s something else on the horizon. Like I can’t really enjoy the present because I’m thinking about everything I have to do before the next *thing*. Maybe the whole “being in the now” thing related to mindfulness would be helpful here? Or recognizing that some phases are longer and have more downtime than others.

Is this just what happens? You grow up and accumulate obligations like a hoarder? Kids come and then you have all their events: birthday parties, school trips, soccer games, ballet practice, chess club. Is there a period in your late 20s/early 30s where events rise as friends get married and have kids, and then it sort of settles back down as you focus more on your family life? Or is the growing list of obligations just something that happens? And you combat it by learning to say “no” to things even when it’s difficult?

I have so many disjointed thoughts about time that I’ll leave it at this for now. Time really is a motherf***er.

Note: the em-dash usage is my favorite punctuation mark. It's a shame it’s turned into some sort of AI/bot giveaway, but real humans do use it! Some people think you can just use "-" (a hyphen) or an en-dash (I'm not even sure how to type those), but alas, [they are wrong](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use).
